Assignment 4


<p>
This code quiz assignment was quite challenging. This took a lot of researching into intervals, JQuery, css styling, for loops and radio buttons.<p>

Although incomplete, I learned a lot of about time management, errors and syntax oops. I am excited to get it finished shortly.<p>
